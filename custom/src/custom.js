// Write whatever additional code you want to be included
// This could be webcomponents added directly here or using import statements
// to pull in and reference other web components / ES module compliant libraries.
// utilize bare imports like import "@things/stuff/stuff.js"; and ensure you reference the js file directly
// to make a custom theme see the following for a well documented fully working example
// https://github.com/haxtheweb/haxtheweb/blob/master/elements/example-haxcms-theme/example-haxcms-theme.js
// don't import that directory, we'd recommend copy and pasting it in here or
// creating your own theme based on it
// references to local node_modules should NOT be bare imports
// so that our local tooling can pick it up and implement
// the change to match
// import "../node_modules/@psul/tei-render/tei-render.js";
